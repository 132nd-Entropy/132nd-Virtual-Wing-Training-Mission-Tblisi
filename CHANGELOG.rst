  etcher]

  menus. [132nd-etcher]

  Flags 20, 30, 40, & 50 will reset themselves to FALSE every time they're activated. That means that the units already spawned at the ranges will start moving, but that any unit spawned afterwards (as a replacement for one that got killed) will HOLD until the radio menu is called again.
